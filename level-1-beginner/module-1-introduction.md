# Module 1: Introduction to RealSense Cameras

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Understand what stereo depth sensing is and how it works
- Compare RealSense cameras with other depth technologies
- Identify the right RealSense camera for your application
- Recognize common use cases and applications

## 📖 What is  RealSense?

 RealSense is a family of 3D depth cameras that use **stereo vision** to perceive the world in three dimensions. Unlike traditional 2D cameras that only capture color information, RealSense cameras provide both color (RGB) and depth (D) data, creating what's called **RGB-D** imaging.

### 🔍 How Stereo Depth Sensing Works

RealSense cameras work similarly to human vision:

1. **Two cameras** (like your eyes) capture slightly different views of the same scene
2. **Software algorithms** compare these views to calculate depth
3. **Depth information** is generated by finding corresponding points between the two images
4. **3D point cloud** is created with X, Y, Z coordinates for each pixel

## 🆚 RealSense vs. Other Depth Technologies

| Technology | How It Works | Pros | Cons | Best For |
|------------|--------------|------|------|----------|
| **RealSense (Stereo)** | Two cameras + algorithms | Cost-effective, good range, color + depth | Affected by lighting, texture dependent | General robotics, AR/VR |
| **LiDAR** | Laser pulses + time-of-flight | Very accurate, works in any light | Expensive, no color, large size | Autonomous vehicles, mapping |
| **Time-of-Flight (ToF)** | Infrared light pulses | Fast, good for close range | Limited range, affected by sunlight | Gesture recognition, close-range |
| **AI Cameras** | Single camera + AI inference | Low cost, no special hardware | Less accurate, requires training | Consumer applications |
